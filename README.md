Algos repository
=================

This repository contains various algorithm implementations and code solutions to interesting problems.
The problems solved herein are either exercise solutions from excellent R. Sedgwecks "Algorithms, 4th ed" 
and the accompanying Coursera course.

Most notably, it contains the following solutions:

1. [Modelling and simualtion] -> <b>Percolation</b> (solved via Quick Union-Find sub-quadratic algorithm)

2. [Elementary data structures] -> <b>Deque and RandomizedQueue</b> (the former uses a doubly-linked list whereas the latter uses a resizing array approach)
3. [Pattern recognition] ->  <b>Collinear Points</b> (detects and prints out coordinates maximum collinear lines in a given set of coordinates in N^2logN time)
4. [Artificial intelligence] -> <b>NPuzzle</b> (NxN puzzle solver which uses heuristics and A* algorithm to reach goal in optimal set of moves)
5. [Computer geometry] -> <b>Kd-Trees</b> (currently in implementation)
6. Some other interesting exercises
